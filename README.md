# SEKOIA.IO CTI AWS Integration

This project involves integrating SEKOIA.IO CTI with AWS security services.

You'll find two stacks.

- One to automatically update a list of malicious IPs detected by AWS Guard Duty.

- The second automatically creates and updates a group of rules with a list of malicious domain names that can be used by AWS Network Firewall.
